{"name":"Origami-rotors","tagline":"code and paper cutout patterns for continuous rotation folded chains","body":"origami-rotors\r\n==============\r\n\r\nA mechanism that admits continuous free rotation between a fixed platform and a rotating body is described. The mechanism is a serial kinematic chain with several revolute joints. The end of the kinematic chain has free and unlimited rotational motion, equivalent to a standard mechanical pivot, but the travel of each individual joint in the chain is limited to less than +/- 70 degrees. The joints that compose the chain can thus be constructed using compliant flexure hinges. The entire mechanism can be folded from a single flat sheet of material, and is thus well suited for self-assembly by folding, which is an increasingly attractive technique for building micro-scale devices. Potential applications include rotating propellers for micro underwater or fluid-immersed (e.g. within a blood vessel) robots, and high-mobility wheel-legs for crawling vehicles.\r\n\r\ncode and patterns\r\n----------\r\nThe code (*.m files) was last tested with GNU Octave. It should work on Matlab also with minor edits. The folder origami-rotors/patterns/ has templates for paper models in US Letter and A4 paper sizes. The svg files are scalable vector graphics files that can be opened with, for example, Inkscape.\r\n\r\n* crcdMakeRibbonMovie.m - Matlab/GNU Octave script creates a short animation of the backbone ribbon\r\n\r\n* crcdPlaybackFullChain.m - Matlab/GNU Octave script creates a short animation of the chain of tetrahedral links. At the octave prompt, you will need to call this script from the origami-rotors/code directory.\r\n\r\nThe animations run nice and quick in Matlab, but quite slowly and with poor lighting in GNU Octave. This may get fixed in the future.\r\n\r\nvideos\r\n-------\r\nA few videos of the ribbon and chain mechanisms can be found at\r\n\r\n* http://youtu.be/gzq5gbF-QC8\r\n* http://youtu.be/ccKN-PoKFPo\r\n* http://youtu.be/AGZfrXsbrTg\r\n* http://youtu.be/dp4zxvpw5og\r\n\r\ngithub pages page\r\n---------------\r\nThis project has a Github-hosted website [here](https://mattmoses.github.io/origami-rotors).\r\n\r\nhow to cite\r\n--------------------\r\nIf you would like to reference this work in a publication, please refer to the [github url](https://github.com/mattmoses/origami-rotors) and cite [this paper](http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1830758):\r\n\r\n\"Origami Rotors: Imparting Continuous Rotation to a Moving Platform Using Compliant Flexure Hinges\", DETC2013-12753, by Matthew S.
